Flagship Real-Time ML/DL + Defense-Oriented Projects
1. Autonomous Threat Detection System
What: Build a system that uses computer vision to detect potential threats (e.g., weapons, intruders, drones) from surveillance footage in real-time.

Tech Stack: YOLOv8 / SSD + OpenCV + TensorRT for acceleration

Bonus: Integrate edge device deployment (Jetson Nano / Raspberry Pi + camera)

2. Dynamic Route Optimization for Combat Units (Real-Time Pathfinding)
What: Create a dynamic pathfinding algorithm for vehicles/drones in hostile terrain that adapts in real-time based on sensor input (obstacles, enemies).

Tech Stack: A*, D*, Dijkstra + reinforcement learning + simulation environment (Unity or custom Python sim)

Bonus: RL + traditional algorithm hybrid

3. Real-Time Communication Jammer Detector using RF Signal Classification
What: Classify radio frequency interference in real-time to detect jamming or spoofing attempts.

Tech Stack: Signal processing with SciPy + LSTM/CNN for waveform classification

4. Voice Command Control System for Tactical Environments
What: Offline voice recognition system that enables soldiers to control drones or bots via specific voice commands (no internet)

Tech Stack: RNN-based speech recognition (e.g., DeepSpeech) + lightweight models

5. Tactical Drone Swarm Simulation with Decentralized ML
What: Simulate multiple drones operating collaboratively to surveil, search, or attack using decentralized ML (e.g., swarm intelligence)

Tech Stack: Python simulation + PyTorch/TF + Flocking algorithms + PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)
